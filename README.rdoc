=Rubualizations

Summary

Rubualizations is a ruby gem which converts ruby hashes into data structures which can be used by (Google Visualizations) to create graphs in your web page.

At present it a partial implementation of the (data source specification described here) which I hope will evolve to cover the complete specification.

Usage

Include the module

    include Rubualizations::Rails::Tableable

In the class definition would you would like to use the module

Define the columns to use by setting the @cols_def (column definition) attribute in the class where you will be converting your hashes 
(or in the initialize method)

    @cols_def = { 
       "dateplaced" => {id: "A", label: "Date Placed", type: "datetime"}
       "profit" => {id: "B", label: "Profit", type: "number"}
    }
    
According to the google visualization API specification (see examples here)[https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/datatables_dataviews]

Then pass the tablize_hashes method a list of hashes which include the attributes defined in the your column definition. In our
example this is 'dateplaced' and 'profit' and return the definitions.

    tablize(hash_list, {cols:"dataplaced,profit"})

If you expose the output of this method to the web you can query your data using the query string

    ?cols=dateplaced,profit
